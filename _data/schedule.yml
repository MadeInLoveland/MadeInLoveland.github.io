    title: Roundtable
    location: CreatorSpace (typically)
    address: 320 Railroad Ave.
    topic: The first part of the meeting is educational with a speaker invited to
      present on a niche topic that is of interest to entrepreneurs.

      The second half of the meeting provides a forum for an entrepreneur to
      solicit collective input from the group.  The entrepreneur has the
      opportunity to present a new business idea, business model or resourcing challenge,
      or area where help is needed to a group of fellow entrepreneurs. The
      group then has the chance to provide constructive feedback and ask questions of
      the presenter that help refocus the entrepreneur's thinking.
