    title: How to Represent Your Product/Company & Look Attactive to Investors
    location: The Armory
    address: 411 Railroad Ave.
    topic: The future is Startups !! Corporate entities cannot create enough jobs
      or innovate fast enough to maintain relevance in the manner they once did.
      So what can we do to overcome the obstacles that limit new company emergence
      and success ? Share - information, contacts and experiences. Working with
      startups is so much a part of my life - I am in the midst of creating my own,
      my 3rd. Acorn has a BHAG ambition - create a path to capital for small and
      new companies, offer a path to equity in the same companies for investors who
      simply don't know how or where to go to participate. Your journey is our
      journey - "What should you talk to us about?" Everything! Looking forward to meeting.
